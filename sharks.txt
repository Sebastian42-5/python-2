Once upon a time, there was a paper
That wanted a story, yet it was empty 
empty from any creativity, any thought.
The story could be about a shark or about 
a superhero, we never know. Our imagination is
unbounded, but this paper is being left alone 
to collect dust, to fold while being dumped into 
a backpack, and getting destroyed by a water bottle 
leak. Protect your paper and your shark story. You will
do much more as a writer in the future.

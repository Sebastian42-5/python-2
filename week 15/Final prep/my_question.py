Implement the p-series and the geometric series as classes using the Progression class that we implemented in class.

The p-series would print the elements for each n as a representation and not as a value itself.

The representation looks like this:

n / d ^ p 

The p-series takes the constant numerator, the denominator and the constant power p. 

As for the g-series, we do want to calculate each current element and print them as we did for the other progressions. You need to decide which functions or constructors that 
the classes inherit from Progression have to be modified or overwritten. 

The g-series takes the a and the r (it's the power that changes).

Create a helping class for the p-series representation.

Finally, create a gSum function inside the g-series class where it would check if the series is convergent given the r provided and if it is, 
it will return its sum. As for the p-series, create a function inside the class called isConvergent that checks if the series is convergent or divergent 
given the p provided. 

Use the concepts of calculus II that we saw on section 8.2

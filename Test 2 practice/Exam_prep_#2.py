Main topic: writing to a txt file 

(the problem also contains sets and nested dictionaries)


You are a backyard fence constructor and you have n costumers in your waiting list.

The waiting list is a nested dictionary where the outer keys are the names of the people in the waiting list (str), 
the inner keys are the dollar bills that each person has (int) and the values of those inner keys are the amount of bills of that type (int)

There are 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 dollar bills.

Every square meter of fence enclosure for the backyard costs an amount of dollars per square meter. 

Once they paid, you have to build the enclosure for each person.


1. write a function called total_change that, given the waiting list and the price of teh fence enclosure by m^2, it will return the name of the person, and the money that they
pay for each person

2. write a function called best_backyard that, given the name and the area of the enclosure for each person, it returns the dimensions that make it so that 
the enclosure looks as much as a square as possible. 

3. On a txt file called fences.txt , you are going to print the name of the person, an empty line, and the enlcosure that is constructed by '_' and '|'

and where a square meter is like this:
 _
|_|

Sample input: 

{'Jessica': {5: 10, 10: 5, 20: 6, 50: 2, 100: 0}, 
 'Bob': {5: 5, 10: 8, 20: 7, 50: 1, 100: 1}, 
 'Kevin': {5: 2, 10: 5, 20: 4, 50: 3, 100: 2}, 
 'Lea': {5: 50, 10: 9, 20: 3, 50: 0, 100: 3} }

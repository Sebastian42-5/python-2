Question 4: Unique Paths
Given a m by n matrix, you are to determine and print the 
number of unique paths starting at the top left corner and
ending at the bottom right corner of the matrix.  The only
possible moves that can be made are either a move to the
right or down. 

Example-1: 

      0  1
[0   [x, x],
 1   [x, x]  ]

path 1: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (1, 1)
path 2: (0, 0) --> (1, 0) --> (1, 1)

=> output: 2


Example-2: 

      0  1  2
[0   [x, x, x],
 1   [x, x, x],
 2   [x, x, x]  ]

path 1: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (1, 2)
path 2: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 2)
path 3: (0, 0) --> (1, 0) --> (1, 1) --> (1, 2)

=> output: 3

# topic 1

'''
You and your friend are doing a challenge: you are playing n tictactoe games combined, put within a dictionary. The X's are 1s and the Os are 2s.

In this tictactoe, there are no order of turns. You and your friends just random put values in the 3 by 3 board spontaneously 

Also, the keys are strings of the name of the player which won the game and the values are the corresponded board in which that player won (which are 2d lists)

This means that at the end, the dictionary with have 2 keys (Player1, Player2) and two values (each value is a list that contains the boards of the corresponded wins of that player)

After you finish one game of these several tic tac toes, you need to store the number of vertical, horizontal and diagonal wins in a dataFrame

Note that since there are no turns, one game could have several wins, so it could have two verticals and a diagonal win for example

You need to generate n random boards and create the dictionary accordingly a) and afterwards, 

use a bar plot to represents the number of vertical wins, horizontal wins and diagonal wins. The bar plot should adjust according to the n tictactoe games played b)

You have to use list comprehension in this question!

So in the end, your code should print the dictionary, the dataFrame that you create to create the bar plot and the bar plot itself.

Good luck!

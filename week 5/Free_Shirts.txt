QUESTION1: FREE SHIRTS

Throughout the year, there are many programming events that students can attend to meet like-minded individuals, hone their skills and, most importantly, get a free t-shirt.

Ian is an avid attender of these events because he hates doing laundry. Ian only does his laundry when all his shirts are dirty, so this constant influx of shirts allows him to put off laundry for longer periods of time.

Ian starts with N clean shirts, wears one clean shirt every day, after which it becomes dirty. If at the beginning of a day (before any events) Ian only has dirty shirts, then he will do the laundry, which makes all his shirts clean again. If Ian goes to an event, then he will receive one clean shirt.

Given the initial number of shirts that Ian has and the schedule of events for the next D days, how many times will Ian do the laundry in the next D days?


INPUT SPECIFICATION:
--> The first line of input consists of three integers N, M, D separated by a space. N represents the initial number of shirts that Ian has.  M represents the number of events coming up and D represents the number of days.  
--> The next line contains M integers, the days on which there are events.  Note that there may be multiple events in a single day.  

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
You are to output the number of times Ian will do the laundry in the next D days.
